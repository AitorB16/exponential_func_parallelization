# exponential_func_parallelization

Use run.sh to compile, execute and get the results in seriean.txt and pareleloan.txt

These files contain respectively results of executing an exponential function in series, and with 2, 4 ,8 and 16 threads.
	The parallelization is done in the inner and outer for iterations, using different schedule types: static and dynamic.

There are some results of the execution in my_results folder, using; 1.9GHz, 4 CPU (12 cores per each) AMD Opteron processors and 64GB RAM (DDR3-1333MHz) machine.
